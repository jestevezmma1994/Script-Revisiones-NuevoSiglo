# Each line is interpreted as having two fields. First field is the
# name of the keymap file (without .map suffix) to be loaded, when
# device name matches the regular expression in the second field.
#
# First field begins with first non-whitespace character and consists
# of non-whitespace characters. Fields are separated by a run whitespace
# characters (at least one of them). The rest of the line forms the
# second field. Lines with invalid format are silently ignored.
