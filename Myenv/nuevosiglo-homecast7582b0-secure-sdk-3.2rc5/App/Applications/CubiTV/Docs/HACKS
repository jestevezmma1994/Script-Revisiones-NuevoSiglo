1. Standby needs to turn off all players. Currently it only revokes tuner from radio/TV
   and uses the fact that PVR player stops playing when its context is poped.
2. Order of turning off players is important as turning of PVR player starts TV player.
3. Traxis uses PC authentication domain instead of its own.
4. Calculator widget scales its input background instead of using a special bitmap or cutting itself a proper one.
5. ChannelScanning turns off tunerMonitor in order to not notify all others about constant changes in tuner.
   It shouldn't be like that: tunerMonitor should know that it is uneeded to notify about changes now
   or all other listeners must somehow know that current tuner changes can be ignored.
